# hypha-ap-allowlist
Hypha's allowlist for Activitypub. Used by our Dripline blog to auto-approve replies to posts

## Format

Our allowlist is stored in `allowlist.txt` in a [social.distributed.press](https://docs.distributed.press/social-inbox/moderation/) compatible format with newline separated items that look like `@*@domain.com`.

## How We Choose

This list was constructed by looking at instances that members are active on and some of the orgs we interact with frequently.

If you believe your instance should be on this list, reach out by opening a new GitHub issue.
